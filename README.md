# netflix-film-suggestion-algorithm

The purpose of this project is creating an algorithm that can process the data and suggest a film/tv show to the user for his/her demands. The dataset that I use is not containing imdb scores of films, so firstly I used Selenium Library to create a bot that can collect all Imdb Scores of Films. Then I processed the data and asked couple of questions to the user. Consequently, I served a list to the user that he/she can watch.
