# Netflix Film Suggestion Algorithm

The purpose of this project is to create an algorithm that can process the data and suggest a film/tv show to the user for his/her demands. 

The dataset that I use is not containing imdb scores of films, so firstly I used Selenium Library to create a bot that can collect all Imdb Scores of Films. Then I processed the data and asked couple of questions to the user. Consequently, I served a list to the user that he/she can watch.

If you  want to run the program, you can run "python algorithm_data.py" on the console.
